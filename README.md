Hogwarts-and-Hobos
==================
A customizable game built in java where you play chicken with Hogwarts trains.
Submitted as final project to Professor V. Misic for Software Engineering Class.
The current build is for now,stable and final.
Bugs:
Mostly Graphic based, the speed at which message from hobos and the passing trains are drawn
make them sometimes not-visible eg. you might get hit by a train without knowing. This may be due
to threading and maybe some use of algorithms.

Feel free to play around with this, if you manage to fix the bugs, it be appreciated if you send me the source at:
